fetchpriority
The fetchpriority attribute allows you to specify the priority for resource types such as CSS, fonts, scripts, images, and iframes. Used to optimize the page load.

<!-- We don't want a high priority for this above-the-fold image -->
<img src="/not-important.svg" fetchpriority="low">

<!-- Initiate an early fetch for a resource, but de-prioritize it -->
<link rel="preload" href="/script.js" as="script" fetchpriority="low">

<script>
  fetch('https://example.com/', {fetchpriority: 'high'})
      .then(data => {
        // Trigger a high priority fetch
      });
</script>

HTTP 103 Early Hints
It is an informational HTTP status code. Servers can send 103 responses with some hints that help a client to make preparations for the final response.

ex - 
<link as="font" crossorigin="anonymous"
      href="..." rel="preload">

The server can include link rel=preload in the final response so that the client can start loading style.css as soon as the headers are received, before parsing the HTML body.

renderBlockingStatus : Identify render blocking resources
erformance API includes the renderBlockingStatus property which provides a direct signal from the browser that identifies the resources that prevent your page from displaying, until they are downloaded.

// Get all resources
const res = window.performance.getEntriesByType('resource');

// Filter to get only the blocking ones
const blocking =   res.filter(({renderBlockingStatus}) =>
      renderBlockingStatus === 'blocking');

New viewport size units
The new viewport units give you more control to create adaptive UIs.
The large lvh (large viewport height) units provide the viewport size assuming that those user agent interfaces are collapsed.

small svh (small viewport height) units provide viewport size assuming the interfaces are expanded.

dvh (dynamic viewport height)And with dynamic units the viewport size will automatically adjust itself in response to browser interface elements being shown or not.

The value will be anything within the limits of the large unit (the maximum) and small units (the minimum).
